# OpenStep for POWERPC, version 5.0.
Continuation of NeXT’s OpenStep, based upon PureDarwin’s codebase.
This is the codebase for the POWERPC release of OPENStep.

The name of the repo will change in a few days to reflect that I am supporting both platforms at once.
I don't have much knowledge of the code, but any help with catching up this release
with the main branch would be appreciated. 

Thanks!
